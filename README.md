# gcse-template
Template repo for GCSE assignments.
This is a standard container template repository for your assignement.
Any cpp files you create related to the assignment can be pushed to this repository.
There is help information for github available at https://docs.github.com/en
Using github is a bit like using Cloud storage i.e. you can create and update folders , files etc.
Each change you make is committed so you have an audit trail of how your file has changed.
### For the assignments you will need to simply add (push and commit) your cpp file to the repository.
You can edit the cpp file using codeblocks during lesson or any other suitable editor at home i.e. vs code.
Suggest you look at CodeSpaces too - it is an online editor.
